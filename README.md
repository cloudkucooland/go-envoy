# go-envoy
Pull data from an Enphase IQ Envoy or IQ Combiner

# This uses the local API, not the Cloud API, so you can poll as frequently as you like
Only basic features will be supported
* reading inventory
* reading current consumption/production/storage data

Tested only with IQ Combiner as that's what I have.
